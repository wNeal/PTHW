Extra Credit 1:
In Terminal where you normally run python to run your scripts, type: pydoc raw_input. Read what it says. If you're on Windows try python -m pydoc raw_input instead.

Extra Credit 2:
Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.

Extra Credit 3:
Go look online for what the pydoc command does.
Extra Credit 4:
Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. It's alright if you do not understand those, just read through and take notes about interesting things.
